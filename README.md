# Xbox Achiever
Allows scripting repetitive tasks for certain games using Xbox streaming app or native PC games.
The goal is to be able to win long and tedious achievements which are only wasting your time pressing the same inputs over and over again for endless hours.
Watch the project as I add new games from time to time when I have a new achievement to tackle.

You will need this in order to send inputs to the game through the keyboard:

Here are the supported games:
- Phantasy Star Online 2 (Dart mini-game and story)
- SpeedRunners (Exp farming)
- SuperBomberman R (Destroy bombs and blocks)
